      <p>
        My name is Phil Vigus and I&apos;m a software developer with a passion
        for building great applications. I live in Sweden with my wife Su, and
        currently work as a Senior Full-Stack Developer for Allakando.

        After qualifying with a degree in Computer Science, I spent the early
        part of my career in the tech industry, initially as a developer before
        moving into business development. I then taught ICT, before taking a
        role in educational quality assurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        About six years a go I changed direction, returning to my roots in
        software development. Since then I&apos;ve worked in a variety of
        programming roles, including backend and full-stack development, and
        consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical expertise, my experience with client and
        customer-facing roles has given me excellent communication and general
        interpersonal skills. I love the blend of creative and analytical skills
        required to be a developer, and seeing an application grow before my
        eyes really excites me. I am happiest when I&apos;m learning, and the
        constantly changing tech landscape means that there will always be
        something new to understand.
